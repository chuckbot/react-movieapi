## React Movie App

Aim of this app is to generate an app to discover new movies fetching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">The Movie DB API</a>.

As a user I can see the most popular movies, search for the ones I like and click on a movie to get some info about it, as well as get similar ones.

## How to use it

```
git clone git@github.com:chuckbot/react-movieapi.git
cd react-movieapi
npm i
npm start

```
